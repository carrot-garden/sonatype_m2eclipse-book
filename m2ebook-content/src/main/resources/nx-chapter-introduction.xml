    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>Nexus manages software “artifacts” required for development,
    deployment, and provisioning. If you develop software, Nexus can help you
    share those artifacts with other developers and end-users. Maven’s central
    repository has always served as a great convenience for users of Maven,
    but it has always been recommended to maintain your own repositories to
    ensure stability within your organization. Nexus greatly simplifies the
    maintenance of your own internal repositories and access to external
    repositories. With Nexus you can completely control access to, and
    deployment of, every artifact in your organization from a single
    location.</para>

    <title>Nexus Open Source</title>

    <para>Nexus Open Source provides you with an essential level of control
    over the external Maven repositories you use and the internal repositories
    you create. It provides infrastructure and services for organizations that
    use repository managers to obtain and deliver software. If you create
    software libraries or applications for your end-users, you can use Nexus
    Open Source to distribute your software. If your software depends upon
    open source software components, you can cache software artifacts from
    remote repositories.</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>When you host a Maven repository with Nexus Open Source, you
            can upload artifacts using the Nexus interface, or you can deploy
            artifacts to hosted repositories using Maven. Nexus will also
            create the standard Nexus Index for all of your hosted
            repositories which will allow tools like m2eclipse to rapidly
            locate software artifacts for your developers.</para>

            <para>When you proxy a remote repository with Nexus Open source
            you can control all aspects of the connection to a remote
            repository including security parameters, HTTP proxy settings. You
            can configure which mirrors Nexus will download artifacts from,
            and you can control how long Nexus will store artifacts and how it
            will expire artifacts which are no longer referenced by your
            build.</para>

          <term>Repository Groups</term>

          <listitem>
            <para>Grouping repositories allows you to consolidate multiple
            repositories into a single URL. This makes configuring your
            development environment very easy. All of your developers can
            point to a single repository group URL, and if anyone ever needs a
            custom remote repository added to the group, you can do this in a
            central location without having to modify every developer’s
            workstation.</para>

          <term>Fine-grained Security Model</term>

          <listitem>
            <para>Nexus Open Source ships with a very capable and customizable
            security model. Every operation in Nexus is associated with a
            privilege, and privileges can be combined into standard Nexus
            roles. Users can then be assigned both individual privileges and
            roles that can be applied globally or at a fine grained level. You
            can create custom administrative roles that limit certain
            repository actions such as deployment to specific groups of
            developers and you can use these security roles to model the
            structure of your organization.</para>

          <term>Flexible LDAP Integration</term>

          <listitem>
            <para>If your organization uses an LDAP server, Nexus Professional
            can integrate with an external authentication and access control
            system. Nexus Professional is smart enough to be able to
            automatically map LDAP groups to the appropriate Nexus roles, and
            it also provides a very flexible facility for mapping existing
            users and existing roles to Nexus roles.</para>

          <term>Artifact Search</term>

          <listitem>
            <para>Nexus Open Source provides an intuitive search feature which
            allows you to search for software artifacts by identifiers such as
            groupId, artifactId, version, classifier, and packaging, names of
            classes contained in Java archives, keywords, and artifact
            checksums. Nexus search makes use of the industry standard for
            repository indexes, the Nexus Index format, and Nexus will
            automatically download a Nexus index from all remote repositories
            which create a Nexus index. Nexus will also automatically expose a
            Nexus index for any hosted repositories you create.</para>

          <term>Scheduled Services</term>

          <listitem>
            <para>Nexus Open Source has the concept of scheduled services -
            periodic jobs which take care of various repository management
            tasks such as deleting old snapshots, evicting unused items, and
            publishing repository indexes.</para>

          <term>REST Services</term>

          <listitem>
            <para>Nexus Open Source is based on a series of REST services, and
            when you are using the Nexus web front-end UI, you are really just
            interacting with a set of REST service. Because of this open
            architecture, you can leverage the REST service to create custom
            interactions or to automate repository management with your own
            scripts.</para>

          <term>Nexus Plugins</term>

          <listitem>
            <para>Nexus Open Source provides a rich API for extension in the
            form of Nexus Plugins. When you write a Nexus Plugin, you can
            customize REST services, the Nexus UI, repository formats, or
            write components that can intercept requests and add new
            capabilities to the platform. The plugin API which you have access
            to in Nexus Open Source is the same plugin API that is used to
            implement value-added features available in Nexus
            Professional.</para>

          <term>Integration with m2eclipse</term>

          <listitem>
            <para>When you use Nexus as a repository manager it creates
            indexes that support some of the next-generation tools available
            in m2eclipse - Sonatype’s Maven plugin for the Eclipse IDE. If you
            publish new artifacts and archetypes to Nexus, they are
            immediately available to m2eclipse project creation wizards and
            are included in m2eclipse search results.</para>

    <title>Nexus Professional</title>

    <para>Nexus Professional was designed to meet the needs of the enterprise.
    It is a central point of access to external repositories which provides
    the necessary controls to make sure that only approved artifacts enter
    into your software development environment. It is also a central
    distribution point with the intelligence required to support the decision
    that go into making quality software. The extensibility provided by the
    custom metadata plugin coupled with REST services only available in Nexus
    Professional also lay the foundation for highly complex interactions
    within the enterprise. Once you start to use the workflow and decision
    support features of Nexus Professional, you will start to see it as the
    “assembly line” - the central collaboration point for your software
    development efforts.</para>

          <term>Nexus Procurement Suite</term>

          <listitem>
            <para>Consider the default behavior of a proxy repository. Any
            developer can reference any artifact stored in a remote repository
            and cause Nexus to retrieve the artifact from the remote
            repository and serve back to a developer. Very often a company
            might want to control the set of artifacts which can be referenced
            in a proxy repository. Maybe the company has unique security
            requirements which require every third-party library to be
            subjected to a rigorous security audit before they can used. Or,
            maybe another company has a legal team which needs to verify that
            every artifact referenced by your software adheres to an
            inflexible set of license guidelines. The Nexus Procurement Suite
            was design to give organization this level of control over the
            artifacts that can be served from Nexus.</para>

        <varlistentry>
          <term>Nexus Staging Suite</term>

          <listitem>
            <para>When was the last time you did a software release to a
            production system? Did it involve a QA team that had to sign-off
            on a particular build? What was the process you used to redeploy a
            new build if QA found a problem with the system at the last
            minute? Because few organizations use a mature process to manage
            binary software artifacts, there is little in the way of
            infrastructure designed to keep track of the output of a build.
            The Nexus Staging Suite changes this by provide workflow support
            for binary software artifacts. If you need to create a release
            artifact and deploy it to a hosted repository, you can use the
            Staging Suite to post a collection of related, staged artifacts
            which can be tested, promoted, or discarded as a unit. Nexus keeps
            track of the individuals that are involved in a staged, managed
            release and can be used to support the decisions that go into
            producing quality software.</para>

        <varlistentry>
          <term>Hosting Project Web Sites</term>

          <listitem>
            <para>Nexus Professional is a publishing destination for project
            web sites. While you very easily generate a project web site with
            Maven, without Nexus, you will need to set up a WebDAV server and
            configure both your web server and build with the appropriate
            security credentials. With Nexus, you can deploy your project’s
            web site to the same infrastructure that hosts the project’s build
            output. This single destination for binaries and documentation
            helps to minimize the number of moving parts in your development
            environment. You don’t have to worry about configuring another web
            server or configuring your builds to distribute the project site
            using a different protocol, you simple point your project at Nexus
            and deploy the project site.</para>

          <term>Support for OSGi Repositories</term>

          <listitem>
            <para>Instead of just supporting Maven repositories, Nexus
            Professional supports OSGi Bundle repositories and P2 repositories
            for those developers who are targetting OSGi or the Eclipse
            platform. Just like you can proxy, host, and group Maven
            repositories, Nexus Professional allows you to do the same with
            OSGi repositories.</para>

          <term>Enterprise LDAP Support </term>

          <listitem>
            <para>Nexus Professional offers LDAP support features for
            enterprise LDAP deployments including detailed configuration of
            cache parameters, support for multiple LDAP servers and backup
            mirrors, the ability to test user logins, support for common
            user/group mapping templates, and the ability to support more than
            one schema across multiple servers.</para>

          <term>Support for Atlassian Crowd</term>

          <listitem>
            <para>If your organization uses Atlassian Crowd, Nexus
            Professional can delegate authentication and access control to a
            Crowd server and map Crowd groups to the appropriate Nexus
            roles.</para>

          <term>The User Account Plugin</term>

          <listitem>
            <para>When you are running a large, public instance of Nexus, it
            is often very useful to allow users to sign up for an account
            without the assistance of an administrator. Nexus Professional’s
            User Account plugin allows for just this. With this plugin
            activate, a new user simply has to fill out a simple form and type
            in letters from a CAPTCHA. Once a user has signed up for Nexus,
            Nexus will then send an email with a validation link. If you are
            working in an environment with hundreds or thousand of users the
            user account plugin will allow you to support the tool without
            having to create logins for each individual user.</para>

          <term>Maven Settings Management</term>

          <listitem>
            <para>Nexus Professional along with the Nexus Maven Plugin allow
            you to manage Maven Settings. Once you have developed a Maven
            Settings template, developers can then connect to Nexus
            Professional using the Nexus Maven plugin which will take
            repsonsibility for downloading a Maven Settings file from Nexus
            and replacing the existing Maven Settings on a local
            workstation.</para>

          <term>Support for Artifact Bundles</term>

          <listitem>
            <para>When software is deployed to the Central Maven repository,
            it is deployed as a signed artifact bundle. Nexus Professional’s
            Staging Suite allows you to upload artifact bundles to a staged
            repository.</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>The software artifacts you download from a remote repository
            are often signed with PGP signatures. Nexus Professional will make
            sure that these PGP signature are valid and the procurement plugin
            defines a few other rules that can be applied to artifacts which
            are downloaded from remote repositories. Nexus Professional also
            defines an API which allows you to create your own custom
            verification rules.</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>Nexus Professional provides a facility for user-defined,
            custom metadata. If you need to keep track of custom attributes to
            support approval workflow or to associate custom identifiers with
            software artifacts, you can use Nexus to define and manipulate
            custom attributes which can be associated with artifacts in a
            Nexus repository.</para>
